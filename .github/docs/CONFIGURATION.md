# Configuration

Configuring the resource is quite simple. 

All of the options are in the `shared/config.lua` file.

## Tow Trucks Config Options

There are 2 different types of tow trucks supported by the script, **scoop based** and **prop based**, each of which have their own unique set of config options.

To select the type of tow truck for a particular entry, use the field `truckType` with either the string `"scoop"` or `"prop"` for their respective types.


### Scoop Based Tow Trucks
Scoop based tow trucks are tow trucks where the bed can be controlled with the same keybinds as the scoop on a dozzer.

*As of version 1.0.0, scoop based tow trucks are not yet supported!*

### Prop Based Tow Trucks
Prop based tow trucks are tow trucks where the bed is togglable via a vehicle extra and where the bed is also streamed as a spawnable object.
